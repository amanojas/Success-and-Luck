# Success and Luck (Average Luck Scores)


This basic app assumes a uniform distribution for both the luck factor and skill factor of individuals.
The app gives the results for pre determined number of participants.
Number of iterations and luck factor are given as inputs by the user.
Luck factor includes everything but skill of an individual, varying from 0 to 1. 
Given the inputs by a user, the app runs simulations for all values of number of participants and gives out a bar chart showing the "Average Luck Scores" of number of participants.
